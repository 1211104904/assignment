# Alien vs. Zombie

Please introduce the game here.

In Alien vs. Zombies, players battle between alien and zombies that share common attributes: life and attack. The objective of this game is for players to control the aliens to defeat all the zombies. Alien and Zombie both have  movements but with different behaviors. Alien attacks the zombies when they encounter each other. The board contains game objects that can interact with the alien by adding more life or changing the alien's movement direction.
